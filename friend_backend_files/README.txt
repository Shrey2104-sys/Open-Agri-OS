# Backend Import Folder

Please upload the files you received from your friend into this folder.

**Files to look for:**
1.  `requirements.txt` (List of dependencies)
2.  `app.py` or `main.py` (The main application code)
3.  Other `.py` files (Helper modules)
4.  `.env` (Environment variables - *Note: You might need to create this yourself if they didn't send it for security reasons*)
5.  Any folders like `static`, `templates`, or `images`.

**Next Steps:**
Once you have pasted the files here, let me know, and I can help you install the dependencies and run their code.
